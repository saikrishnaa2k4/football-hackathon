# jQuery Kick Challenge
An interactive penalty shootout game built with HTML, CSS, and jQuery. Press Enter to shoot past two moving goalkeepers. The ball realistically stops on collision with a keeper, but a quick double-click resets the game for another try. It's a fun, simple demo of browser-based animation and event handling.
